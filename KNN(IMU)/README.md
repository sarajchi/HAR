# Start

**1_Feature_Extraction_IMU.py**

This script performs IMU feature extraction and generates the file All_IMU_Features.csv.

The dataset is already included in the repository, so running this script is optional.

**2_KNN_IMU_Training_Evaluation.py**

This script executes the KNN (IMU) model and produces the classification report, confusion matrix, and other evaluation outputs.

The corresponding results are already provided in the repository.
